Presenter: Sadit Rasaili
Affiliation: Kathmandu University
(Use this script alongside the slides and abstract provided; relevant files: slides and abstract.) 



Total talk time target: 12–15 minutes (adjust per session).
Delivery tips: speak clearly, pause after each major point, point to slide elements with your laser pointer or cursor, keep hands relaxed. Use a slightly slower pace for methodology and results. When referencing a figure, physically gesture to it.

Slide 1 — Title / Opening (20–30s)

“Good [morning/afternoon]. I’m Sadit Rasaili from Kathmandu University. Thank you to the organizers of KHWOPA CEEL 2026 for this opportunity. Today I’ll present our project: KU Smart Meter Monitoring and Analytics System — a real-time platform for campus energy monitoring, forecasting, and analytics. (Pause, make eye contact.)”

Slide 3 — Introduction (40–60s)

“Modern energy systems need real-time visibility to improve efficiency and reliability. Traditional analog meters only give cumulative readings; they don’t reveal short-term events like voltage dips, load spikes, or outages. Smart meters produce high-resolution streams — energy, voltage, current, power factor — which we can use to monitor and predict grid behavior. Our system ingests that high-resolution data and turns it into actionable dashboards and forecasts for campus energy managers.” (Show Slide 3.)

Slide 4 — Project Objectives (30–45s)

“Concretely, our objectives were: (1) develop a scalable web-based monitoring platform, (2) integrate secure real-time data acquisition via APIs, (3) provide interactive visualizations, (4) implement AI-based short-term forecasting, and (5) design a modular architecture for future growth. These goals guided the design and tool choices described next.” (Point to the bulleted objectives on the slide.)

Slide 5 — Problem Statement (40–50s)

“Context: Kathmandu University operates multiple buildings with varying loads. The problems we aimed to address were: no centralized real-time monitoring, poor visibility into voltage instability and outages, no predictive tools for peak management, and limited data-driven planning. Existing IoT platforms are often generic — we needed a customizable system tailored to academic campus needs.” (Emphasize the ‘Need’ bullet.)

Slide 6 — System Context Diagram (20–40s)

“Here is the high-level context diagram. From smart meters, data is pushed to our backend via a secure API. The backend stores time-series data and serves RESTful endpoints to the frontend dashboard and model training pipelines.” (Briefly trace the data flow with your finger or pointer.)

Slide 7 — Development Approach (45–60s)

“We adopted an agile approach with iterative sprints: planning and requirements, research on smart meter APIs and forecasting models, frontend in React, backend in FastAPI, PostgreSQL for time-series storage, and Random Forest regression for short-term forecasting. Docker was used for containerized deployment to make the system modular and portable.” (Keep steady pace and mention the stack visually.)

Slide 8 — Data & Machine Learning (60–75s)

“Model: Random Forest Regression. Input features included hour of day, day of week, month, and historical lag values to capture temporal patterns. Our dataset contains 8,355 samples, split 80/20 into 6,684 training and 1,671 testing samples. The model predicts short-term demand (24-hour horizon) to help anticipate peaks and support load management decisions.” (Point to the dataset numbers and feature list on the slide.)

Slide 9–15 — System Demonstration / Screens (2–3 minutes total)

[These slides show the web UI — main dashboard, individual meter, analysis, prediction, billing, maps, admin.]

For each slide:

Main Dashboard (Slide 9 / Figure 2): “This is our home dashboard — real-time consumption trends, quick stats and alerts. Use this to spot unusual spikes quickly.”

Individual Meter Page (Slide 10 / Figure 3.1): “Per-meter view shows waveform-level trends, voltage, current, and power factor historically and in real time.”

Analysis Page (Slide 11 / Figure 4): “Deeper analytics: daily, weekly aggregations, and comparisons across blocks.”

Prediction Page (Slide 12 / Figure 5): “Here are the model forecasts alongside actuals; managers can see predicted peaks before they occur.”

Billing Page (Slide 13 / Figure 6): “Automated billing calculates costs by tariff slabs for transparency and auditing.”

Maps Page (Slide 14 / Figure 7): “Geographical meter mapping helps locate affected buildings during outages or anomalies.”

Admin Dashboard (Slide 15 / Figure 8): “Role-based controls, user management, and access levels for administrators.”

(When you reach each screenshot: point to the UI element you describe. Keep each mini-description to ~20–25 seconds.)

Slide 16 — Visualization & Prediction Results (45–60s)

“Our visualizations provide clear insight into consumption trends, voltage stability, and peak identification. On prediction: qualitatively, model predictions follow actual consumption well, capturing non-linear consumption behavior — which is valuable for anticipating peak demand and planning. (Refer attendees to the prediction slide for visual fit.)”

Slide 17 — Model Performance (30–45s)

“Figure 9 shows the Actual vs Predicted R² error plot. Use this slide to explain model fit — point to how the points align around the diagonal line to indicate goodness-of-fit. If asked for numeric metrics, refer to this plot and report R² (and MAE/RMSE if available from your logs).” (Don’t invent numbers here; promise to provide exact metrics in the Q&A or follow-up if they request them.)

Slide 18 — Conclusion (40–50s)

“To conclude: we developed a scalable real-time smart meter monitoring system that integrates IoT APIs, offers interactive dashboards, includes automated billing, and provides short-term demand forecasting. This system lays the groundwork for smarter campus energy management and research.” (State succinctly and confidently.)

Slide 19 — Limitations & Future Work (45–60s)

“Limitations include dependency on external API availability and model accuracy being tied to historical data quality. Future work: real-time anomaly detection with automated alerts, mobile app support, advanced deep learning models for improved forecasting, and optimization recommendations for energy savings.” (Highlight the most plausible near-term enhancements.)

Anticipated questions (with concise suggested answers)

Q: How does this generalize to other campuses?
A: The architecture is modular; meter connectors and the ingestion pipeline are configurable. With API credentials and minor mapping, it can be deployed to other campuses.

Q: What about data privacy and security?
A: We use JWT-based authentication for API access, role-based access control for users, and network-level security (HTTPS, container isolation). For sensitive datasets, encrypt-at-rest and strict DB ACLs are recommended.

Q: How accurate is the forecast?
A: Refer to the Actual vs Predicted plot (slide 17). It shows close alignment; for exact R²/MAE values, we can provide the numeric metrics from our evaluation logs.

Q: Can this detect faults or anomalies in real time?
A: The current system visualizes and highlights voltage instability and outages. Anomaly detection is a planned enhancement and can be integrated as a streaming model that triggers automated alerts.

Q: How do you handle missing data or API downtime?
A: The ingestion pipeline queues and retries data. We also store raw messages and flag missing windows so forecasting uses imputations or excludes unreliable intervals.

Q: Cost/ROI for campus deployment?
A: Savings depend on how insights are acted upon (demand-side management, targeted maintenance). We can estimate ROI by comparing baseline consumption and forecasted peak reductions after optimization.

(Keep answers short and offer to follow up with detailed numbers or a demo if the questioner wants more.)

Delivery & staging notes

Time management: Aim ~1 minute per major section; keep demo slides fast (20–30s each).

Visual focus: When talking about a figure, freeze on that slide; let the audience read the axes while you summarize main takeaway.

Questions: Repeat each question before answering. If you need to share repo or data, point to the GitHub link on the slides.

Short summary to memorize (30s elevator pitch)

“We built a Dockerized, FastAPI-backed smart meter analytics platform for Kathmandu University that ingests high-resolution smart meter data via the Iammeter API, stores it in PostgreSQL, visualizes it with React dashboards, performs Random Forest–based short-term forecasting, and automates billing — enabling proactive management of campus energy.
